# Q-Learning-implemetation-for-custom-grid-world

This Repository contains Python implementation for Q-Learning algorithm which is a popular model free Reinforcement Learning technique that is used to find optimal policy.The project includes a custom-built GridWorld environment where an agent learns to navigate from a starting position to a goal while avoiding obstacles (if any).As of now there aren't any obstacles defined. You can define as per your requirements. The Q-Learning algorithm is implemented with an epsilon-greedy action selection strategy, allowing the agent to balance exploration and exploitation.


## Features 
* Custom Grid Environment with configurable grid size 
* Q-Learning Algorithm with adjustable hyper parameters
* Epsilon Greedy method for action selection
